# Enumerable Methods
This project is based on creating my own versions of some of the methods in the Enumerable module. This project is from [The Odin Project's Cirriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks?ref=lnav). This projecrt also showcases experience with TDD.
